A dime a dozen
Dog
Cat
Needle In a Haystack
It is a piece of cake
That is a good idea
Head Over Heels
Like Father Like Son
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Get your act together
Go back to the drawing board
It is not rocket science
No pain, no gain
Speak of the devil
Under the weather
A penny for your thoughts
Take it outside
Break the ice
Do not cry over spilt milk
Go on a wild goose chase
Ignorance is bliss
Down To The Wire
Next time
Swinging For the Fences
Hard Pill to Swallow
Call it a day
A blessing in disguise
It is Not All It is Cracked Up To Be
High And Dry
Elephant in the Room
Shot In the Dark
Jazz
Buzz
Jinx
Abyss
